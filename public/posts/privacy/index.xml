      <description>Back then &amp;hellip; I remember that I used to dismiss privacy-concerned people (of which I knew basically one) as paranoid. I used to be one of the people who asked the rhetorical question of &amp;ldquo;But who would care about my data?&amp;rdquo; followed by &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to hide&amp;rdquo;.

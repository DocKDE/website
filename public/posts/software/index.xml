      <description>What? For those who do not know: an operating system (OS) is the software that runs your device, the most popular ones being Windows, MacOS, Android and iOS.
It takes care of communicating with the hardware (that is hard drive, graphics card, processor etc.) and starts it up, provides you with the nice graphical interface that you&amp;rsquo;re (probably) used to and much more. It is also the layer underneath all the applications you&amp;rsquo;re using, like Office, a browser or games.</description>

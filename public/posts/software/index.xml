      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently realized something. My use of the Linux operating system and all it offers has been evolving in something of a wave-like pattern.
When I started out, the first thing I tried was Linux Mint which is something a former Windows user might do as it works in a fairly familiar way. I quickly realized that I wanted to dive deeper and do more things than what Mint let me do easily.</description>

      <description>A while ago I stumbled across some mention of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey which found that the Rust language has held the spot of most loved programming language since 2016. That seemed interesting to me but I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow it up in any way.
A while later I came across some Rust tutorial videos on one of the YouTube channels I frequently visit and looked into it a bit. Looked pretty involved to me and that was that again.</description>

      <title>Choosing an Operating System</title>

      <description>What? For those who do not know: an operating system (OS) is the software that runs your device, the most popular ones being Windows, MacOS, Android and iOS.
It takes care of communicating with the hardware (that is hard drive, graphics card, processor etc.) and starts it up, provides you with the nice graphical interface that you&amp;rsquo;re (probably) used to and much more. It is also the layer underneath all the applications you&amp;rsquo;re using, like Office, a browser or games.</description>

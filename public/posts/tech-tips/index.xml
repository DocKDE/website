      <description>A tale as old as time: you configure and tweak your personal machine that you use for work, coding, fun and games or whatever and at some point you wonder how you might preserve all those tweaks. Either, you want to back them up (which is always sensible) or you want to transfer to a new machine or want to show them to other people online so they can just download your setup and get going immediately.</description>

      <title>Running a script on conda activate</title>

      <description>I recently noticed that using a conda environment can come with a couple inconveniences. For example, since the default Python executable changes when activating conda, this means that the $PATH variable has been modified and some software can not be found anymore.
For instance, I can&amp;rsquo;t call PyMol from command line when in a conda environment because it somehow depends on the Python executable, it seems.
I recently installed some software into a conda env, that needs a couple of environment variables to run but which I only really need (or want) when running this software in this conda env because it messes with $PATH and disrupts my workflow otherwise.</description>

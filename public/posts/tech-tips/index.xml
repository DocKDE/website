      <description>I recently noticed that using a conda environment can come with a couple inconveniences. For example, since the default Python executable changes when activating conda, this means that the $PATH variable has been modified and some software can not be found anymore.
For instance, I can&amp;rsquo;t call PyMol from command line when in a conda environment because it somehow depends on the Python executable, it seems.
I recently installed some software into a conda env, that needs a couple of environment variables to run but which I only really need (or want) when running this software in this conda env because it messes with $PATH and disrupts my workflow otherwise.</description>

      <title>Choosing an Operating System</title>

      <description>What? For those who do not know: an operating system (OS) is the software that runs your device, the most popular ones being Windows, MacOS, Android and iOS.
It takes care of communicating with the hardware (that is hard drive, graphics card, processor etc.) and starts it up, provides you with the nice graphical interface that you&amp;rsquo;re (probably) used to and much more. It is also the layer underneath all the applications you&amp;rsquo;re using, like Office, a browser or games.</description>

      <description>Back then &amp;hellip; I remember that I used to dismiss privacy-concerned people (of which I knew basically one) as paranoid. I used to be one of the people who asked the rhetorical question of &amp;ldquo;But who would care about my data?&amp;rdquo; followed by &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to hide&amp;rdquo;. This was my point of view some three years ago.
&amp;hellip; and now Fast forward to now:
  I have banned everything Facebook, Google and Microsoft from my household.</description>

      <description>Hello world Dear reader, I finally made it! Although I have basically no experience with web development, here is my personal website. I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited about this and it&amp;rsquo;s going to be interesting to see where it takes me. Of course I&amp;rsquo;d like to take all the credit but the truth is that there are software and services out there that make this kind of endeavour relatively easy and painless.</description>

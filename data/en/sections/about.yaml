resume: "files/cv_english.pdf"

summary: "I am an experimental-turned-computational chemist and hobby developer with a passion for free software. Professionally, I have mostly worked on transition-metal-containing systems
such as enzymes and model complexes thereof and studied their geometric/electronic structure and properties. Notable examples would be Mo-based models of nitrogenase, spin crossover compounds
and Cu-containing enzymes for C-H bond activation.
Privately, I like coding and tinkering with the machines in my home network that I use as small but useful servers. I love learning and discovering new stuff to
integrate in my workflow and am generally enthusiastic about free software and the freedom and possibilities it offers."

summary: "I am an experimental-turned-computational chemist and hobby developer with a passion for free software. Professionally, I have mostly worked on transition metal&#8211;containing systems
such as enzymes and model complexes thereof and studied their geometric/electronic structure and properties. 
Privately, I like coding tinkering with software. I love learning and discovering new stuff to
integrate in my workflow and am generally enthusiastic about free software and the freedom and possibilities it offers. When not doing any of that I enjoy getting together with friends
for good food and board games (the more complex the better) or relaxing with a good book."
